Question,Answer
write me a simple golang app,"```go
package main

import ""fmt""

func main() {
  fmt.Println(""Hello, World!"")
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`package main`**: This line declares the package name as ""main"". This is necessary for the code to be compiled and executed as an executable program.
* **`import ""fmt""`**: This line imports the ""fmt"" package, which provides functions for formatted input and output, including the `Println` function.
* **`func main() { ... }`**: This defines the main function, which is the entry point for the program execution. Any code inside this function will be executed when the program starts.
* **`fmt.Println(""Hello, World!"")`**: This line calls the `Println` function from the ""fmt"" package to print the string ""Hello, World!"" to the console.

**To run this program:**

1. **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.go` file (e.g., `hello.go`).
2. **Compile:** Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Then, run the following command:
   ```bash
   go build
   ```
   This will create an executable file named `hello` (or the filename without the `.go` extension) in the same directory.
3. **Run:** Execute the executable file by typing:
   ```bash
   ./hello
   ```

This will output the following to your console:

```
Hello, World!
```

This is a simple example demonstrating the basic structure of a Go program. You can modify the code to create more complex applications.

write me a simple golang app,"```go

func main() {
	fmt.Println(""Hello, World!"")
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **`package main`:** This line declares the package name as `main`, which is the entry point for executable Go programs.
* **`import ""fmt""`:** This line imports the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatted input and output, including `Println`.
* **`func main() { ... }`:** This defines the `main` function, which is automatically executed when the program starts.
* **`fmt.Println(""Hello, World!"")`:** This line uses the `Println` function from the `fmt` package to print the string ""Hello, World!"" to the console.

**To run this code:**

1. Save the code as a `.go` file (e.g., `hello.go`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4. Run the command `go run hello.go`.

This will compile and run the code, and you should see the output ""Hello, World!"" printed to the console.
